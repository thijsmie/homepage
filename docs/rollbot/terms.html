    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                  By using the app rollbot via Discord, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. The application
                  is open source, will forever be open source and is available to anyone.
                  Thijs Miedema provides these at no cost and with no warranties under the 
                  MIT license.
                </p> <p>
                  Thijs Miedema is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The rollbot app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, to provide my Service, in
                  accordance with the privacy policy.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Thijs Miedema’s responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Thijs Miedema accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The requirements 
                  for the system(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to accept the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Thijs Miedema does not promise that it
                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the  version that you have
                  installed. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
